title:  "How I Improved My Chess Elo with Python"
date:   2023-11-02

Iâ€™ve been playing chess on Lichess for the past 2 years to improve my chess skills. Over that time Iâ€™ve seen an increase in my elo of over 900!

However, over the past few months that growth has become stagnant, and Iâ€™ve been stuck just below the rating of 1900 elo.

I knew that studying my chess openings would be the only way to cross this threshold, but that seemed like a lot of manual work. Luckily, I know a bit of Python.

I started by creating a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joeyagreco/daily-chess) to store my code. I then looked at Lichessâ€™ [API documentation](https://lichess.org/api) and found that they have endpoints that allow users to retrieve games by username... just what I needed.

Using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), I sent a few requests to the Lichess API to see what filters I would need and how they format their responses.

I knew the following:

- I wanted only rated games
- I wanted only Blitz games
- I wanted the games sorted from most to least recent
- I wanted the name of the opening for each game

Using the query parameters outlined in the documentation, I found that I would need a URL like this:

```sh
https://lichess.org/api/games/user/drcoffeeki11?rated=true&perfType=blitz&sort=dateDesc&opening=true&finished=true&tags=true&max=100
```

Now that I knew where I could get the data I needed, it was time to code!

I wonâ€™t walk you through all of the code (you can take a look at it here), but the main flow of it looks like this:

1. Define environment variables for my use case

    ```sh
    LICHESS_USERNAME=drcoffeeki11
    NUM_GAMES=100
    PERF_TYPE=blitz
    RUN_AT_TIME=10:00
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/12345/abcdefg
    DISCORD_DAILY_OPENINGS_TO_SEND=3
    ```

2. Extract the net elo in the past 100 games for each opening and save the game URLs

    ```py
    openings_and_net_elo = defaultdict(float)          # store net elo for each opening
    openings_and_game_urls: dict[str, list[str]] = {}  # store game URLs for each opening
    for game in games:
        if game.opening_name not in openings_and_game_urls.keys():
            openings_and_game_urls[game.opening_name] = []
        openings_and_net_elo[game.opening_name] += game.elo_for_user(USERNAME)
        if game.winner_username != USERNAME:           # I tied or lost, save this game URL
            openings_and_game_urls[game.opening_name].append(game.game_url)
    openings_and_net_elo = dict(openings_and_net_elo)
    ```

3. Send the results every morning to a private Discord server via a [webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)


    ```py
    @classmethod
    def send_webhook(cls, *, url: str, embeds: list[dict]) -> None:
        data = {"embeds": embeds}
        cls._rest_call(requests.post, url, json=data)
    ```
    ```py
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        schedule.every().day.at(EnvironmentReader.get("RUN_AT_TIME")).do(main)

        while True:
            schedule.run_pending()
            time.sleep(1)
    ```

When run, the code ends up sending messages that look like thisâ€¦

![Discord message 1](/img/posts/2023-11-02/discord_message_1.png)

![Discord message 2](/img/posts/2023-11-02/discord_message_2.png)

![Discord message 3](/img/posts/2023-11-02/discord_message_3.png)

![Discord message 4](/img/posts/2023-11-02/discord_message_4.png)

â€¦to a private Discord server Iâ€™m in.

Now every morning when I receive these messages, I can click the links to the games whose openings I struggle with the most, and study the positions with Stockfish right on Lichessâ€™ website!

The last step was to build this into a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) so I could run it on my [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) server and not have to worry about it constantly running on my personal computer.

And thatâ€™s it! 1900 here I come ðŸš€
